Rust Australia Sydney Meetup 

This repository is simply a physical RSVP tracking

[RustAU/Virtual](https://github.com/RustAU/Virtual) repository serves as virtual RSVP tracking and Call for Papers submissions

The idea is to have hybrid meetup where we have virtual as well as physical RSVP when we secure venue
